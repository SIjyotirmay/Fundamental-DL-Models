undamental Deep Learning Models from Scratch (PyTorch)

ðŸš€ This repository contains fundamental deep learning architectures implemented from scratch in PyTorch.
The goal is to provide clean, educational implementations of key models like ResNet, UNet, and ResUNet, along with training scripts, pretrained weights, and reproducible experiments on standard datasets.

ðŸ“Œ Implemented Models

ðŸŸ¦ ResNet (Residual Networks) â€“ for image classification

ðŸŸ© UNet â€“ for semantic segmentation

ðŸŸ§ ResUNet â€“ Residual U-Net for segmentation

(More fundamental models may be added in the future.)
